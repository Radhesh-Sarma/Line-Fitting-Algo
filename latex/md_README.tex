Make run.\+sh an executable to run the code.

\doxysection*{./run.sh will\+:}

1) Take input points from input.\+txt (least\+\_\+sq\+\_\+new.\+cpp)

2) Sort the points w.\+r.\+t. increasing x, if x coordinates of two points are the same, then sort with increasing y (least\+\_\+sq\+\_\+new.\+cpp)

3) Compute the segments of best fit (least\+\_\+sq\+\_\+new.\+cpp)

4) Store the information of segments in output.\+txt (least\+\_\+sq\+\_\+new.\+cpp)

5) Plot the points and segments (plotter.\+py)

xn yn

Where N is the number of points, C is the cost of one segment and the coordinates of the ith point are \mbox{[}xi,yi\mbox{]}

j i cost a b

..

(one line for each segment)

For each segment, i is the left-\/most point included in fitting, j is the right-\/most point included in fitting. Total cost incurred by a segment is given by cost. Slope of line is a, intercept is b.
